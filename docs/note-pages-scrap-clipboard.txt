📌 Platform, Banking & Tech Stack


📌 User Login & Subscription Management Flow
This flow describes how JobHackAI users authenticate, access their subscription data, and manage billing through the integrated payment system. It involves multiple components working together to provide a seamless and secure user experience.
Flow Steps:
User Login The user logs into the JobHackAI site using email and password. The frontend captures credentials and initiates the login process.
User Lookup in Google Sheets via Zapier The frontend sends a request to Zapier to look up the user’s record in Google Sheets, which serves as the lightweight database storing user plan info and Stripe Customer IDs.
User Data Returned Zapier queries Google Sheets, finds the user’s row, and returns the user information (subscription plan, Stripe Customer ID) back to the frontend.
Manage Subscription Request When the user clicks “Manage Subscription,” the frontend requests a Stripe Customer Portal session from Zapier, providing the Stripe Customer ID.
Stripe Portal Session Creation Zapier calls Stripe’s API to create a Customer Portal session for the user.
Portal URL Returned Stripe returns a URL for the Customer Portal session to Zapier, which then forwards it to the frontend.
Redirect to Stripe Customer Portal The frontend redirects the user’s browser to the Stripe Customer Portal, where the user can update payment methods, view invoices, or cancel their subscription.
Quick Login (Dummy) demo@jobhackai.com / password123 (Free) trial@jobhackai.com / password123 (Trial) essential@jobhackai.com / password123 (Essential) pro@jobhackai.com / password123 (Pro) premium@jobhackai.com / password123 (Premium)
Why this architecture?
Lightweight user data store: Google Sheets enables easy, cost-effective storage of user metadata and plan status without a complex database.
Zapier integration: Acts as a secure middleware, connecting the frontend with Google Sheets and Stripe APIs without exposing secrets client-side.
Stripe Customer Portal: Provides a secure, PCI-compliant way for users to self-manage billing without requiring custom billing UI development.
Seamless UX: The flow is designed so users experience minimal friction when logging in and managing their subscriptions.

Rationale for Unlimited ATS Scoring in Trial
Increases perceived value and conversion, in line with industry competitors.
Minimal cost impact per scan.
Ensures the upgrade push comes from other feature caps (feedback, rewrites, LinkedIn, etc.).
📌 Additional Implementation Decisions (Committed)
Cover‑Letter Scoring (V2 Backlog) – Separate feature allowing users to upload/paste their own cover letter for an AI score & feedback (Pro/Premium in V2).
Interview Questions Soft‑Cooldown – Abuse prevention: max 1 question‑set request per minute for all plans.
Relay Sub‑Account Structure – Create Operating, Tax, Marketing, and Reserve buckets to silo cash inside Relay Bank.
Token‑Cost Strategy – Run résumé & LinkedIn scoring on GPT‑3.5‑turbo‑1106; reserve GPT‑4o for mock‑interview feedback to control OpenAI spend.
Social‑Proof Automation – Zapier workflow: Stripe trial ➜ Sheets ➜ LinkedIn DM request ➜ live testimonial carousel update on homepage.
Design Token Expansion – Add spacing (--space-1…--space-6), typography scale (--fs-h1…--fs-small), shadow (--elev-1, --elev-2), breakpoint (--bp-sm…--bp-xl), and motion (--trans-fast) tokens to the Design System.
Canonical Snippet Library – Create Snippets.md containing the authoritative HTML/CSS for Button, Input, and Card components.
Prompt Contract Update – Future prompts must reference tokens and snippets explicitly: “Insert <!-- Button --> snippet verbatim; use var(--space-3) for padding.” ** – Zapier workflow: Stripe trial ➜ Sheets ➜ LinkedIn DM request ➜ live testimonial carousel update on homepage.
🚀 Next Steps

These tasks are committed decisions as of 2025‑04‑27 and must be completed before public launch.
Query Bar (above the list) Fields: Role (combobox) Seniority (Select: Intern/Junior/Mid/Senior/Lead/Director) Question Type (Toggle chips: Behavioral / Technical / System Design / Leadership / Culture) Count (10) Advanced (accordion): “Paste Job Description (optional)” textarea to tailor the set.  On each question card:  Copy, Replace (swap just this one), Save ⭐, Notes (open a small textarea).  Cooldown & statuses (your 1/min rule) After Generate/Regenerate, show a non-blocking toast: “New Set ready.” Disable Generate/Regenerate with a countdown badge “0:58”  Session history (lightweight) Right side on desktop / collapsible on mobile: “Recent Sets” (role, timestamp, 10 questions). Click to restore.      Access & plan logic (aligned with pricing matrix) Free: page locked → CTA card “Upgrade to try Interview Questions.” Trial/Essential/Pro/Premium: unlimited generation with 1/min cooldown. Mock Interview CTA: visible but locked for Trial/Essential; clickable for Pro/Premium.
Control without re-rolling the whole set If 1–2 questions miss, “Replace” swaps just those. You avoid burning a full regeneration and keep momentum.
Faster practice → better retention “Copy” and “Save ⭐” let users build a tight, personal set in seconds. That’s how people actually prep—curate, repeat, refine.
Answer quality jumps “Notes” + “Show Answer Guidance” (STAR hints) push users to structure answers. That’s the difference between rambling and concise.
Clean upsell path “Start Mock Interview with saved set” becomes a natural Pro/Premium funnel. Trial/Essential see a lock + tooltip instead of a dead end.
Great telemetry Clicks on Replace/Save/Copy tell us what topics are weak, which roles need more coverage, and who’s ready to upgrade.
How it works (concrete examples)
A) Replace (surgical swap)
User sees Q3: “Describe a time you disagreed with a teammate.”
It’s not relevant. They hit Replace → we call POST /questions/replace with { role, seniority, types, jd, replaceIndex: 3 }.
New Q3 appears with a 5-second micro-cooldown badge on the Replace button only. Generate/Regenerate cooldown stays intact.
B) Save ⭐ (curate a study set)
User stars Q1, Q4, Q7.
A “Saved (3)” chip appears in the toolbar.
They can open “Saved Set” → Copy All / Download PDF / “Start Mock Interview with saved set”.
Trial/Essential click the Mock Interview action → feature-lock modal explains Pro benefits and links to pricing.
C) Notes (capture the story beats)
On Q2: “Tell me about a time you improved a process.”
User taps Notes, a small textarea drops under the card.
We pre-fill a STAR scaffold:
	S:
	T:
	A:
	R:
They jot: “Cut CI build time 22% by caching deps, parallelizing tests.”
Auto-save to localStorage (or user profile later). On revisit, it’s there.
D) Show Answer Guidance (lightweight coaching)
Toggle at the top: Show Answer Guidance.
Each card reveals a one-liner hint (no walls of text):
Hint: “Quantify outcome; mention tools; keep it under 90 seconds.”
Users can click “Example” to expand a 3-sentence STAR sample (optional).
E) Copy (snackable export)
Copy on a single card copies just that question.
Copy All in the toolbar collects the current list (or the Saved Set) for pasting into Notes/Google Docs. Instant value.

———   [Mode: UltraDeep Thinking]

Before answering, silently run multiple reasoning passes (at least 3), aiming for the most robust solution. If the answer isn’t optimal after those passes, continue iterating until it is.

Process to follow (internally):
1) Frame: Restate the objective and constraints in one line.
2) Decompose: Break the task into minimal subtasks.
3) Explore: For each subtask, consider multiple approaches (incl. unlikely angles) and their trade-offs.
4) Falsify: Challenge your own assumptions; try to disprove your preferred approach.
5) Verify x3: Check facts, names, dates, units, and any math digit-by-digit; run consistency and sanity checks across steps.
6) Risk & Unknowns: Identify uncertainties, edge cases, and what could change the answer.
7) Optimize: Select the best approach and tighten it for clarity and utility.

Output format (show only this):
- **Answer:** (final, concise, directly solves the user’s request)
- **Why this works (brief):** 3–5 bullets summarizing the key reasoning and trade-offs (no step-by-step chain of thought).
- **Assumptions & Uncertainties:** bullets
- **Quality checks passed:** facts verified, calculations checked, contradictions resolved
- **Next step (if any):** one actionable suggestion

Rules:
- Be rigorous, precise, and practical. No filler, no hedging.
- If critical data is missing, state what’s missing and proceed with the best defensible default.
- Prefer explicit structure, crisp language, and verifiable claims over verbosity.
  Inline add-on (if you just want a one-liner to append to any prompt):  Use UltraDeep Thinking: run ≥3 internal reasoning passes with decomposition, adversarial self-check, triple verification, and multi-angle analysis; then return only a concise final answer + brief rationale, assumptions, checks passed, and next step.   git add . && git commit -m "<commit-message>" && git checkout main && git fetch origin && git pull origin main && git merge <branch-name> && git push origin main && git branch -d <branch-name> && git push origin --delete <branch-name>
