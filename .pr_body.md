Summary

This PR makes a minimal, frontend-only cleanup and documentation update in `resume-feedback-pro.html` related to the feedback run "authority" token used to gate rendering of role-specific feedback. No API, scoring, toast, or behavioral logic is changed beyond removing two redundant calls.

What changed

- Added a short, explicit inline documentation block describing the feedback run token lifecycle (placed immediately above the token helpers).
- Introduced `clearActiveFeedbackToken()` earlier in the work (already present in this branch) and ensured token cleanup points exist for run completion and non-retryable errors. (Note: those implementations were part of this branch's prior edits.)
- Removed two redundant explicit calls to `clearActiveFeedbackToken()` that were immediately following `clearScoreAuthority(...)`:
  - Removed redundant call in `resetSession()` (immediately after `clearScoreAuthority('reset-session')`).
  - Removed redundant call in `resetFormToDefault()` (immediately after `clearScoreAuthority('reset-form')`).

Why this change

- `clearScoreAuthority()` already calls `clearActiveFeedbackToken()`, so the explicit clears were redundant. Removing them reduces duplication and makes the intent clearer to future maintainers.
- The inline comment documents the lifecycle of the feedback run token so maintainers understand why the token is set/cleared and which flows must preserve or clear it.

Scope & constraints

- Frontend-only change in `resume-feedback-pro.html`.
- No changes to backend endpoints, AI prompts, scoring logic, or toast behavior.
- Intentionally minimal: only documentation and two redundant-line removals were applied.

Files changed

- `resume-feedback-pro.html` — inline comment added; two redundant `clearActiveFeedbackToken()` calls removed.

Behavioral & safety notes

- The canonical token cleanup points (end-of-run Promise.allSettled handlers and explicit non-retryable error branches) remain unchanged and authoritative.
- Removing the redundant clears is safe because `clearScoreAuthority()` continues to call `clearActiveFeedbackToken()`.
- No UI timers or delayed actions rely on the removed calls; these calls were duplicates that immediately followed `clearScoreAuthority(...)`.

Testing performed

- Verified the file compiles (no linter errors reported via project linter check on this file)
- Verified git commit and push succeeded; PR created via CLI.

Rollback

- Revert the PR or reset the branch to the previous commit if needed. Changes are localized to a single file.

Notes for reviewers

- Focus review on `resume-feedback-pro.html` around the feedback token helpers and the `resetSession()` / `resetFormToDefault()` functions.
- Confirm no functional tests or integrations rely on the removed duplicate calls (unlikely since they were redundant).
