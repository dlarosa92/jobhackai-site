          <p>Confidence in an interview is not a personality trait — it is a byproduct of preparation. The candidates who perform best in interviews are not necessarily the most talented or the most experienced. They are the most prepared. And preparation is something you can systematize. Here is a 7-day framework that turns interview anxiety into grounded confidence.</p>

          <h2>Day 1: Deep-Dive the Company and Role</h2>
          <p>Before you can answer "Why do you want to work here?" convincingly, you need a genuine answer. Spend 60-90 minutes on day one doing real research:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Read the company's "About" page, mission statement, and recent news (press releases, LinkedIn updates, blog posts)</li>
            <li>Review the job description line by line — map each requirement to a specific experience you have</li>
            <li>Look up your interviewers on LinkedIn — note their background, tenure, and any shared connections</li>
            <li>Search for recent earnings calls, product launches, or industry news about the company</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The goal is not to memorize facts — it is to develop a genuine perspective on the company and why this specific role makes sense for you at this point in your career.</p>

          <div class="callout">
            <div class="callout-label">Research Tip</div>
            <p>Find 2-3 specific, recent things about the company that genuinely interest you. Mentioning them in your answers demonstrates real engagement, not rehearsed enthusiasm.</p>
          </div>

          <h2>Day 2: Build Your Story Bank</h2>
          <p>Almost every behavioral interview question is a variation of "tell me about a time when..." The STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) is the standard framework for answering these, and it works — if your stories are concrete and well-practiced.</p>
          <p>Build a bank of 8-10 stories from your career that you can adapt to different questions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A time you solved a difficult problem under pressure</li>
            <li>A project where you demonstrated leadership (even without a formal leadership role)</li>
            <li>A time you had a conflict with a colleague and how you resolved it</li>
            <li>Your biggest professional failure and what you learned from it</li>
            <li>A time you exceeded expectations or delivered an unexpected result</li>
            <li>A decision you made with incomplete information</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For each story, write out the STAR structure in 4-6 bullet points. You are not writing a script — you are building a mental outline you can navigate fluidly.</p>

          <h2>Day 3: Practice Common Questions Out Loud</h2>
          <p>Reading interview answers in your head and speaking them out loud are completely different experiences. Day three is entirely about vocalization. Set a 45-minute session and answer these questions aloud:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>"Tell me about yourself." — practice a 90-second, past/present/future narrative</li>
            <li>"Why are you interested in this role?" — use your Day 1 research</li>
            <li>"What is your greatest strength?" — pick one and prove it with a story</li>
            <li>"What is your greatest weakness?" — pick a real one and show growth</li>
            <li>"Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"</li>
            <li>3-4 role-specific behavioral questions based on the job description</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Record yourself if possible. Most people are surprised by how different they sound versus how they feel internally — and recording reveals filler words, pacing issues, and answers that are too long or too vague.</p>

          <h2>Day 4: Research Role-Specific Technical Questions</h2>
          <p>Behavioral questions are universal. Technical questions are role-specific. Spend day four identifying the technical or functional questions most likely to come up for your specific role:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Search "[role title] interview questions" on Glassdoor and Indeed</li>
            <li>Look at Glassdoor reviews for the specific company — interview experiences are often documented</li>
            <li>Review your resume for any skills or tools listed that you might be rusty on — refresh them</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Day 5: Prepare Thoughtful Questions to Ask</h2>
          <p>The end of every interview includes "Do you have any questions for us?" This is not a formality — it is evaluated. Candidates who ask no questions signal low engagement. Candidates who ask generic questions signal shallow research.</p>
          <p>Prepare 6-8 questions so you have plenty after some get answered during the conversation:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Questions about the specific challenges of the role ("What does success look like in the first 90 days?")</li>
            <li>Questions about team dynamics and how the role fits the larger organization</li>
            <li>Questions about the company's direction based on your research ("I saw you recently announced X — how does that affect this team?")</li>
            <li>Questions about the interviewer's own experience ("What do you enjoy most about working here?")</li>
          </ul>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Never ask about salary, benefits, or time off in a first interview unless the interviewer brings it up. Save those for the offer stage.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <h2>Day 6: Full Mock Interview</h2>
          <p>Day six is a dress rehearsal. Do a full 30-45 minute mock interview — ideally with a friend, but solo recording works too. Set up your space exactly as it will be on interview day (video background, lighting, positioning). Go through the full arc:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Opening small talk (have 1-2 natural responses ready)</li>
            <li>"Tell me about yourself"</li>
            <li>3-4 behavioral questions from your story bank</li>
            <li>2 role-specific technical questions</li>
            <li>"Do you have any questions for us?"</li>
            <li>Closing (how you express continued interest without desperation)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Review the recording critically. Note any answers that felt weak, rushed, or rambling. Fix them.</p>

          <h2>Day 7: Light Review and Mental Preparation</h2>
          <p>The day before your interview is not for heavy preparation — it is for consolidation and mental readiness. Cramming new material now will create noise, not signal.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Re-read your story bank bullets once</li>
            <li>Confirm logistics: time, location (or video link), contact name, what to bring</li>
            <li>Lay out your clothes, charge your devices</li>
            <li>Sleep on time — preparation fatigue is real and shows in interviews</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="callout">
            <div class="callout-label">On Confidence</div>
            <p>Confidence is not the absence of nerves — it is trusting your preparation enough that nerves do not derail you. By day 7, you have done the work. Trust it.</p>
          </div>

          <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
          <p>Seven days is enough to move from anxious and under-prepared to genuinely confident and well-prepared. The system works because it separates different types of prep into focused sessions rather than mixing them all into one overwhelming cram. Start this routine as soon as an interview is scheduled and you will walk in ready.</p>
