          <p>LinkedIn has over 1 billion members. Recruiters are searching it every day for candidates exactly like you — but if your profile is not optimized, you are invisible to them. LinkedIn's search algorithm works a lot like Google: it surfaces profiles with strong keyword relevance, complete profile data, and active engagement. Here is how to make yours rank.</p>

          <h2>The Headline: Your Most Valuable Real Estate</h2>
          <p>Your LinkedIn headline is the first thing recruiters see after your name. Most people write their current job title, which is a missed opportunity. Your headline is searchable text — it shows up in recruiter searches, connection requests, and comment threads. You have 220 characters to use.</p>
          <p>A strong headline formula: <strong>Target role + key differentiator + credibility signal</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Weak: "Marketing Manager at Acme Corp"</li>
            <li>Strong: "Senior Marketing Manager | B2B SaaS Growth | $10M+ pipeline generated via demand gen & content strategy"</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The strong version tells a recruiter searching for "B2B marketing manager" exactly what you do, how experienced you are, and what results you drive — before they click your profile.</p>

          <div class="callout">
            <div class="callout-label">Quick Win</div>
            <p>Open LinkedIn right now and count how many searchable keywords are in your headline. If it is just your job title, you are leaving recruiter visibility on the table.</p>
          </div>

          <h2>The About Section: Write for Humans, Optimize for Search</h2>
          <p>The About section (formerly Summary) is your 2,600-character pitch. Recruiters read it to understand whether you are a fit for the roles they are filling. The opening two lines matter most — they show before the "See more" fold.</p>
          <p>Structure your About section in three parts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Opening hook (2 lines):</strong> Who you are and what you are known for. Make a recruiter want to click "See more."</li>
            <li><strong>Core narrative (3-4 short paragraphs):</strong> What you specialize in, key achievements, industries you have worked in.</li>
            <li><strong>Closing call to action:</strong> What opportunities you are open to and how to reach you.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Weave in keywords naturally — the specific tools, skills, and role titles that recruiters in your field search for. LinkedIn's algorithm weighs the About section heavily for search ranking.</p>

          <h2>Work Experience: Accomplishments, Not Descriptions</h2>
          <p>The biggest mistake candidates make in the Experience section is treating it like a job description. Recruiters do not need to know your daily responsibilities — they need to know what you achieved.</p>
          <p>For each role, lead with impact:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Instead of: "Managed social media accounts for the brand."<br>
            Write: "Grew Instagram following from 12K to 89K in 14 months, driving a 34% increase in referral traffic to the company website."</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Use numbers wherever possible. Percentages, dollar amounts, team sizes, and timeframes make accomplishments concrete and credible. LinkedIn's algorithm also picks up these terms as signals of seniority and specialization.</p>

          <h2>Skills: Choose Strategically, Endorse Consistently</h2>
          <p>LinkedIn allows up to 50 skills. Most people use 10-15 generic ones. The right approach:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>List the top 10 skills most relevant to your target role in the first positions (these are shown prominently)</li>
            <li>Use exact phrasing from job descriptions in your field — "Project Management" and "PMP Certification" are different signals</li>
            <li>Ask former colleagues to endorse your top 5 skills — endorsements improve your ranking in recruiter searches</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The Open to Work Feature: Use It Correctly</h2>
          <p>LinkedIn's "Open to Work" frame signals availability to both the public and recruiters. If you are in a confidential search, use the "Recruiters only" setting — this hides the green banner from your current employer while still appearing in recruiter-specific searches. If you are openly searching, the public banner statistically increases recruiter outreach.</p>

          <h2>Profile Completeness: The Algorithm Prerequisite</h2>
          <p>LinkedIn scores profile completeness internally and uses it as a ranking factor. To hit "All-Star" status (the highest tier), you need:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A profile photo (profiles with photos get 21x more views)</li>
            <li>A background / banner image</li>
            <li>Your industry and location set</li>
            <li>Current position with description</li>
            <li>Education section filled in</li>
            <li>At least 5 skills listed</li>
            <li>At least 50 connections</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="callout">
            <div class="callout-label">Profile Photo Tip</div>
            <p>Your photo does not need to be professionally taken — but it must be recent, clear, and show just your face with a plain or blurred background. Profiles without photos are nearly invisible in recruiter search results.</p>
          </div>

          <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
          <p>LinkedIn optimization is not a one-time task — it is a system. Start with the highest-impact changes: rewrite your headline, update your About section opening, and convert your job descriptions into accomplishment bullets. Then complete your profile to All-Star status. These changes compound over time as LinkedIn's algorithm learns who you are and begins surfacing your profile in the right searches.</p>
